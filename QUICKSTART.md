## üîß Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Cannot connect to server"
**Solution**: Make sure Flask is running (python pharmacy_app.py)

### Issue: "No counties showing in dropdown"
**Solution**: Verify `synthetic_patient_data_with_distances.csv` exists

### Issue: "Map not displaying"
**Solution**: Check internet connection (map tiles load from OpenStreetMap)

### Issue: "No predictions in Tab 4"
**Solution**: Ensure `pharmacy_found_model.joblib` file exists in project directory

### Issue: Port 5000 already in use
**Solution**: 
```powershell
# Find and kill process on port 5000
Get-Process -Id (Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 5000).OwningProcess | Stop-Process
```

## üí° Tips

1. **Tab 1**: Works best with real county names from your data
2. **Tab 2**: Try different clusters to see varying distance patterns
3. **Tab 3**: Select multiple counties to see total cost estimation
4. **Tab 4**: Larger CSV files take longer to process
