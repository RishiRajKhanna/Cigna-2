## How to Run

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install flask flask-cors pandas numpy joblib
```

### 2. Start the Application
```bash
python pharmacy_app.py
```

### 3. Access the Application
Open your browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:5000
```

## Data Requirements

### Tab 1 Input
- County selection from patient data
- Medical conditions (checkboxes)
- Pregnancy status

### Tab 2 Input
- Cluster/Group selection

### Tab 3 Input
- Automatic loading from patient data (distance >10 miles)
- User selects counties via checkboxes

### Tab 4 Input
- CSV file with columns:
  - `patient_id`
  - `age`
  - `gender`
  - `is_senior_citizen`
  - `is_pregnant`
  - `has_chronic_illness`
  - `annual_salary`
  - `number_of_children`
  - (other columns will be preserved)

## Cost Calculation Method (Tab 3)

The cost calculator estimates pharmacy construction costs based on:
- **Base Cost**: $500,000 (standard pharmacy construction)
- **Patient Volume Multiplier**: $1,000 per potential patient
- **Formula**: `Estimated Cost = Base Cost + (Patient Count × $1,000)`

This provides a reasonable estimate that scales with demand.

## ML Model Integration (Tab 4)

The application loads the pre-trained model from `pharmacy_found_model.joblib`. If the model is not found:
- Statistics will still be calculated
- Predictions section will show "Model not available"
- Application continues to function

## Responsive Design

The application is fully responsive and works on:
- Desktop computers (optimal experience)
- Tablets
- Mobile phones (with optimized layouts)

## Browser Compatibility

Tested and compatible with:
- Google Chrome (recommended)
- Mozilla Firefox
- Microsoft Edge
- Safari

## Error Handling

All endpoints include error handling for:
- Missing files
- Invalid data
- Empty datasets
- File upload issues
- Model loading failures

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

While the current implementation is complete, potential future additions could include:
- User authentication
- Data export functionality
- Advanced filtering options
- Real-time data updates
- Database integration
- Historical trend analysis

## Notes

1. **Tab 1** is intentionally minimal - only distance information as requested
2. **Tab 2** provides deep subgroup analysis across multiple dimensions
3. **Tab 3** includes full map integration with interactive checkboxes and cost calculation
4. **Tab 4** requires the ML model file to be present for predictions

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check that all required files are present
2. Verify Flask is running on port 5000
3. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
4. Verify CSV file format for Tab 4 uploads
